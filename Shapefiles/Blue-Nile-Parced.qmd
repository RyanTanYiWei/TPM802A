Locally registered the image to the vector data using ArcView® GIS Image Analysis creating shapefiles of the current water area. These shapefiles were used as the basis for updating the current extent of the rivers leading to the sea. Copied ArcGIS® layer file (.lyr), ArcView GIS legend file (.avl), and projection file (.prj) and created spatial indices. The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the features from ArcWorld 1:25M. Aligned the mouths of rivers with coastlines. Made features consistent with all political boundaries they are coincident with. Added attribute values from the Rand McNally New International Atlas, the Times Atlas of the World, the Digital Chart of the World, and World Resources Institute. Added St. Lawrence system from ArcWorld 1:3M. Generalized to match detail of the Cntry00.shp. Removed unneeded attributes. Created ArcGIS® layer file (.lyr). Created ArcView GIS legend file (.avl). Created projection file (.prj). Ran ArcView GIS Avenue™ request ExportClean, and created spatial indices. Data sources used in this process: ArcWorld 1:3M, ArcWorld 1:25M Rand McNally Int. Times Atlas DCW NASA Visible Earth Date: 20020925 (change 2 of 4) The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded all image sources from the online links. Locally registered the images to the vector data using ArcView GIS Image Analysis creating shapefiles of the current water areas. These shapefiles were used as the basis for updating the current extent of the rivers leading to these water areas. Created ArcGIS® layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC. Data sources used in this process: NASA Visible Earth NASA Earth Observatory JSC DIC SouthWestern Bell WorldRoom http://landsat7.usgs.gov Earthshots from the EROS Date: 20040307 (change 3 of 4) The following steps were performed by ESRI: Added KILOMETERS attribute and calculated its values. Added MILES attribute and calculated its values. Date: 20050215 (change 4 of 4) The following steps were performed by ESRI: Deleted the shoreline (lake) features. The MILES and KILOMETERS attribute values were not recalculated. Reduced the attribute widths for NAME and SYSTEM. Corrected a spelling error.</history>
